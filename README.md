# Tag

This mod is a collection of multiple gamemodes all in one mod! The mod contains 9 gamemodes, modifiers that effect the gameplay of the gamemode, in-depth, easy to understand settings, and statistics!

### Gamemodes

Tag contains multiple tag-related gamemodes! All gamemodes involve "tagging" another player. There are as of right now 9 different gamemodes. These gamemodes are Tag, Freeze Tag, Infection, Hot Potato, Juggernaut (meh), Assassins, Sardines, Hunt, and Deathmatch! Each gamemode gives it's own fun to the mod!

### Modifiers

There are plenty of modifiers to add variety your game! From simple gravity changes to blasters and fog, modifiers add plenty of enjoyable (or annoying) changes to the base gamemodes!

### Romhacks

Romhack support depends on the romhack. Offical romhacks have paintings, and pipes like vanilla levels! Non-official romhacks don't have these benefits, however, the romhack should still work perfectly fine!

### Blacklists

Don't like a gamemode, modifier, or level? Blacklist it! Blacklisting allows you to turn off certain gamemods, modifiers, or levels that you don't like in your game.

### Stats

Each player has stats! These stats go from playtime, total tags, and total time as runner, to total runner victories and tagger victories. The best part is each gamemode gets it's own statistics for each of these metrics!

### Frequently Asked Questions

- Does this support sm64ex-coop/sm64coopdx
  - Yes, this mod supports both repos. I try to test both, however if there's a bug with a specific one, [make an issue](https://github.com/EmeraldLoc/tag/issues) so I can fix the problem.
- Does this support romhacks?
  - Yes, tag supports romhack. If you wanna add paintings and such to romhacks, you can make what I call an official hack, you can see how to do that [here](./romhacks.md). It also contains a blacklist so that you can remove levels that don't work with it.
- Can I use code contained in this mod for my own mods?
  - Usually yes, credit is not required, just make sure you understand how the code your copying works, and that you aren't just copying massive blobs of code, and I'm fine with it.
- Can I publish custom versions of this mod?
  - If you haven't considered a contribution to the repo instead, then consider that. Otherwise, it's fine so long as it does not contain code taken from newer, unreleased versions of tag, and does not contain code from other mods without credit. I would also like to be in the credits of these mods. I would also hold the right to take any code of the mod and add it to base tag (credit would be added to the creator of said mod). You get to use my code with credit, I get to use yours with credit, fair?
- How can I contribute to the repo?
  - You can fork the repo [here](https://github.com/EmeraldLoc/tag/fork), then contribute to the repo by creating a pull request.
- Where can I report bugs or suggestions?
  - You may report bugs or suggestions [here](https://github.com/EmeraldLoc/tag/issues).
- How will I know that a update has released?
  - Versions 2.1 and up have an update notifier, however this will only be activated once v37 of coop comes out, or when coopdx also fixes the bug currently stopping it from working.
- When do you beta test new versions of Tag?
  - There isn't really a set time. They typically happen when I got a good feature set for a next version. Expect more testing when the next version reaches the R.C stage, which you can know when I host it lol.
- What are the stages of a new release?
  - Typically it goes thru 2 stages. A beta stage, this is where features are rough, and everything is prone to chage. When I feel comfy with a build, I make that a Release Canidate (R.C.) build. R.C. means that the next version is not too far away, while beta means you still have a ways to go.
